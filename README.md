# Connect Four Game in Java 

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect Four game, developed in Java. The game allows two players to take turns dropping discs into a 7x6 grid, with the objective of being the first to connect four discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features 
- Console-based gameplay.
- Two-player mode.
- Simple and intuitive game mechanics.
- Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections.
- Draw detection when the board is full.

## How to Play
1. **Player Turns**: Players take turns to drop their disc into one of the seven columns.
2. **Win Condition**: The first player to connect four of their discs in a row wins the game.
3. **Draw Condition**: If the board is full and no player has connected four discs, the game ends in a draw.
